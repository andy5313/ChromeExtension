# ChromeExtension

Aim:

Build a chrome extension with the ability to block specific websites, and when you go on those websites, it will pop up with a meme/song.


The websites to block:  

- facebook
- etc
- etc


Funny meme / output:

- have embedded spotify focus playlist + random quotes popping up (cal newport ones?)


Extension:

If the above is solved with plenty of time to spare then we will add functionality of adding a daily timer for allowing those sites.
